Iâ€™m truly impressed by the exceptional flow chart for system architecture, the comprehensive and detailed user stories, and the well-organized calendar and career path design with key events highlighted. The feedback from real user testing, client-centric approach, and creative ideas are commendable. Additionally, your code structure and database design have been a great source of inspiration for me.
