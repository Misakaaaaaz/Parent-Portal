# XP Summary

## Key Points about XP:
- XP is an agile software development methodology that emphasizes customer satisfaction, teamwork, and rapid delivery of high-quality software.
- t was created by Kent Beck and first implemented in 1996.
- XP is based on five core values: communication, simplicity, feedback, respect, and courage.
- It involves 12 core practices, including pair programming, test-driven development, continuous integration, and small releases.
- XP projects work in short iteration cycles, typically 1-3 weeks long.
- The methodology aims to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

## Core Practices of XP
### Pair Programming: 
Two developers work together at one workstation, which helps improve code quality and facilitates knowledge sharing.
### Test-Driven Development (TDD): 
Writing tests before the code to ensure functionality and guide development.
### Continuous Integration: 
Frequently integrating and testing code to avoid integration issues.
### Refactoring: 
Continuously improving the design of existing code without changing its functionality.
### Small Releases: 
Delivering small, functional pieces of software frequently.
### Collective Code Ownership: 
Everyone in the team can contribute to any part of the codebase.
### Sustainable Pace: 
Working at a pace that can be sustained indefinitely, avoiding burnout.
